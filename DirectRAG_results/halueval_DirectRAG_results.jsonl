The seventh-largest country by land area is Canada.\n\nThe reference context provides information about three specific moths: Sevenia boisduvali (a butterfly), Autumnal moth, and Many-plumed moth. None of these genera are from Canada, and the information given does not specify the number of species or the location of these genera.\n\nGiven that we need to find a genus of moth unique to Canada and containing only one species, we need to use external knowledge.
